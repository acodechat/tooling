# Introduction
1. Whatever is listed here is and always will be **ONLY** for experienced developers!
2. **THIS IS OVERKILL**
3. This is **REALLY** incomplete

With that out of the way lets begin!

## Frontend 
I will sugest using our serverless project which is a **WIP**

## Backend
I would suggest using a stdlib api which would make it easier for you to do stuff

## Database
Use firebase store no in house solution

## Git
Use our gh action along with our acode app to incorporate git.
